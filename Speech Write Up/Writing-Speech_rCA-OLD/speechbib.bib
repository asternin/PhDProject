@article{Deng2010,
	Abstract = {We conducted an experiment to determine whether the rhythm with which imagined syllables are produced may be decoded from EEG recordings. High density EEG data were recorded for seven subjects while they produced in imagination one of two syllables in one of three different rhythms. We used a modified second-order blind identification (SOBI) algorithm to remove artefact signals and reduce data dimensionality. The algorithm uses the consistent temporal structure along multi-trial EEG data to blindly decompose the original recordings. For the four primary SOBI components, joint temporal and spectral features were extracted from the Hilbert spectra (HS) obtained by a Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT). The HS provide more accurate time-spectral representations of non-stationary data than do conventional techniques like short-time Fourier spectrograms and wavelet scalograms. Classification of the three rhythms yields promising results for inter-trial transfer, with performance for all subjects significantly greater than chance. For comparison, we tested classification performance of three averaging-based methods, using features in the temporal, spectral and time-frequency domains, respectively, and the results are inferior to those of the SOBI-HHT-based method. The results suggest that the rhythmic structure of imagined syllable production can be detected in non-invasive brain recordings and provide a step towards the development of an EEG-based system for communicating imagined speech.},

@article{Blankertz2011,
	Abstract = {Analyzing brain states that correspond to event related potentials (ERPs) on a single trial basis is a hard problem due to the high trial-to-trial variability and the unfavorable ratio between signal (ERP) and noise (artifacts and neural background activity). In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive framework for decoding ERPs, elaborating on linear concepts, namely spatio-temporal patterns and filters as well as linear ERP classification. However, the bottleneck of these techniques is that they require an accurate covariance matrix estimation in high dimensional sensor spaces which is a highly intricate problem. As a remedy, we propose to use shrinkage estimators and show that appropriate regularization of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) by shrinkage yields excellent results for single-trial ERP classification that are far superior to classical LDA classification. Furthermore, we give practical hints on the interpretation of what classifiers learned from the data and demonstrate in particular that the trade-off between goodness-of-fit and model complexity in regularized LDA relates to a morphing between a difference pattern of ERPs and a spatial filter which cancels non task-related brain activity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Farwell1988,
	Abstract = {This paper describes the development and testing of a system whereby one can communicate through a computer by using the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP). Such a system may be used as a communication aid by individuals who cannot use any motor system for communication (e.g., 'locked-in' patients). The 26 letters of the alphabet, together with several other symbols and commands, are displayed on a computer screen which serves as the keyboard or prosthetic device. The subject focuses attention successively on the characters he wishes to communicate. The computer detects the chosen character on-line and in real time. This detection is achieved by repeatedly flashing rows and columns of the matrix. When the elements containing the chosen character are flashed, a P300 is elicited, and it is this P300 that is detected by the computer. We report an analysis of the operating characteristics of the system when used with normal volunteers, who took part in 2 experimental sessions. In the first session (the pilot study/training session) subjects attempted to spell a word and convey it to a voice synthesizer for production. In the second session (the analysis of the operating characteristics of the system) subjects were required simply to attend to individual letters of a word for a specific number of trials while data were recorded for off-line analysis. The analyses suggest that this communication channel can be operated accurately at the rate of 0.20 bits/sec. In other words, under the conditions we used, subjects can communicate 12.0 bits, or 2.3 characters, per min. },

@article{Cruse2011,
	Abstract = {Patients diagnosed as vegetative have periods of wakefulness, but seem to be unaware of themselves or their environment. Although functional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown that some of these patients are consciously aware, issues of expense and accessibility preclude the use of fMRI assessment in most of these individuals. We aimed to assess bedside detection of awareness with an electroencephalography (EEG) technique in patients in the vegetative state. This study was undertaken at two European centres. We recruited patients with traumatic brain injury and non-traumatic brain injury who met the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised definition of vegetative state. We developed a novel EEG task involving motor imagery to detect command-following - a universally accepted clinical indicator of awareness - in the absence of overt behaviour. Patients completed the task in which they were required to imagine movements of their right-hand and toes to command. We analysed the command-specific EEG responses of each patient for robust evidence of appropriate, consistent, and statistically reliable markers of motor imagery, similar to those noted in healthy, conscious controls. We assessed 16 patients diagnosed in the vegetative state, and 12 healthy controls. Three (19) of 16 patients could repeatedly and reliably generate appropriate EEG responses to two distinct commands, despite being behaviourally entirely unresponsive (classification accuracy 61-78). We noted no significant relation between patients' clinical histories (age, time since injury, cause, and behavioural score) and their ability to follow commands. When separated according to cause, two (20) of the five traumatic and one (9) of the 11 non-traumatic patients were able to successfully complete this task. Despite rigorous clinical assessment, many patients in the vegetative state are misdiagnosed. The EEG method that we developed is cheap, portable, widely available, and objective. It could allow the widespread use of this bedside technique for the rediagnosis of patients who behaviourally seem to be entirely vegetative, but who might have residual cognitive function and conscious awareness.
