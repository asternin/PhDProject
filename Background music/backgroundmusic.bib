	Abstract = {There are correlational1, historical2 and anecdotal3 relationships between music cognition and other `higher brain functions', but no causal relationship has been demonstrated between music cognition and cognitions pertaining to abstract operations such as mathematical or spatial reasoning. We performed an experiment in which students were each given three sets of standard IQ spatial reasoning tasks; each task was preceded by 10 minutes of (1) listening to Mozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K488; (2) listening to a relaxation tape; or (3) silence. Performance was improved for those tasks immediately following the first condition compared to the second two.},

Each task was \hl{preceded} by 10 minutes of mozart, relaxation tape, or silence. 
Performance on the task after listening to mozart was improved compared to the other 2 conditions. 
The enhancing effect of the music condition does not extend beyond the 10-15 minute period during which the subjects were engageed in the spatial task. 
Including a delay period would allow researchers to determine quantitatively the presence of a decay constant. },

Music Listening: Rauscher et al - Mozart effect paper in 1993. 
Replication attempts were not always successful. Meta-analysis by Chabris, et al (1999) speculated mozart effect has to do with arousal. 
\\
Schellenberg paper - Schubert, and Stephen King effect. Arousal has to do with preference. Tasks were performed \hl{after} listening. 
\\
Thompson, Schellenberg, and Husain (2001) show that mood also plays a role - more arousal with happy songs. 
\\
Music Lessons: Schellenberg (2004) paper assigned children to music lessons or comparison conditions. Children in music lessons had larger increases across the four main areas of intellectual ability measured by the WISC-III - compared to drama, control groups. 
\\
Music listening and music lessons can lead to short-term and long-term cognitive benefits, respectively. This positive answer is qualified because the short-term benefits of music listening do not appear to differ from those associated with other stimuli that optimize arousal level or elicit mild positive affect.},

	Abstract = {Recent research extending Broadbent's work on selective auditory attention is described through the medium of the irrelevant sound effect (the loss of efficiency when irrelevant sound is played during a serial short-term memory task). This breakdown of selective attention cannot be explained by interference at encoding, but rather as disruption following some obligatory entry of sound into memory. Within memory, interference does not arise as a result of the conflict between the contents of memory and the irrelevant sound, since neither phonological nor semantic similarity predicts its extent. Instead, the interference seems to be a product of the similarity in processÐthe degree of seriationÐbetween rehearsal in short-term memory and the perceptual organization of the irrelevant sound. This type of breakdown in selectivity is likely to have relatively great practical impact, particularly since it is relatively insensitive to loudness and does not appear to diminish with repeated exposure.},

@article{Colle1976,
	Abstract = {Primary memory (or short-term memory), according to models such as Sperlingis, maintains a substantial amount of its information by storing it in an auditory sensory memory. Since the auditory sensory memory is used to store memory information these models predict that concurrent auditory stimulation should destroy memory information and, hence, reduce recall performance. To test this hypothesis, a foreign language was presented over earphones while subjects performed a serial recall task with visual presentations and written recall. The subjects were told to ignore the noise. In Experiment I the presence of the irrelevant foreign language noise reduced recall performance on phonologically different lists but it did not reduce performance on phonologically similar lists. Passive articulatory restraint had little effect. In Experiment II this noise effect was eliminated after 30 sec of silent arithmetic, indicating that the noise effect is a primary memory phenomenon. ?? 1976 Academic Press, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Most research on auditory distraction on task performance focuses on those features of the sound that determine a drop in efficiency, with scant regard for examining the processing properties inherent in the focal task. We report how one such property, retrieval strategy, can also influence the degree of disruption by background sound. Using a task that called for the retrieval of realistic train journey information, we showed that retrieval by categories of verbal sequences was not susceptible to disruption by office sound - 65-75 dB(A). However, versions of the task requiring either free or serial recall showed evidence of disruption, a pattern of results consistent with the changing-state account of the irrelevant sound effect, which highlights the key role of serial rehearsal in determining disruption.},

@article{Beaman1997,
	Abstract = {The effects of irrelevant speech were examined on a range of memory tasks. A missing-item task, which relied on a nonserial strategy for recall, proved less sensitive to the effects of irrelevant speech than one calling on memory for serial order. The finding that the effect of irrelevant speech both on a recognition task and on a paired-associates task was modified significantly by articulatory suppression further suggested that memory for serial order is the dominant feature of these tasks and that it renders them vulnerable to disruption by irrelevant speech. Taken together, the results of the experimental series support the notion that tasks involving memory for serial order are particularly susceptible to disruption by irrelevant speech. These and other findings converge on the notion that interference with information processing by irrelevant sound is based on similarity of process rather than similarity of content.},

musicians scored higher during silence and music-correct, but not music-incorrect.

visuospatial search results: musicians completed more items correctly.
no interactions or other main effects
\\
These findings challenge the view that music and language are functionally independent in expert musicians, and instead suggest that when musicians process music they recruit a network that overlaps with the network used during language processing. 
Interference is exacerbated by the additional processing requred to parse grammtically incorrect music.
In summary, the performance of musicians was negatively affected by the presence of background music compared to silence when performing a language comprehension task involving grammaticality judgements. Performance was not affected in a visuospatial task.
\\
In short, there is emerging (but incon- sistent) evidence indicating that executive function abilities may be enhanced as a result of music lessons and could, therefore, contribute positively to general cognitive functioning in musicians},

	Abstract = {Although liked music is known to improve performance through boosting one's mood and arousal, both liked music and disliked music impair serial recall performance. Given that the key acoustical feature of this impairment is the acoustical variation, it is possible that some music may contain less acoustical variation and so produce less impairment. In this situation, unliked, unfamiliar music could be better for performance than liked, familiar music. This study tested this by asking participants to serially recall eight-item lists in either quiet, liked or disliked music conditions. Results showed that performance was significantly poorer in both music conditions compared with quiet. More importantly, performance in the liked music condition was significantly poorer than in the disliked music condition. These findings provide further illustration of the irrelevant sound effect and limitations of the impact of liked music on cognition.},
	Annote = {Research has shown that performance is equally as poor on serial recall whether the participant likes the music or not (Perham \& Vizard, 2010). A key feature of this latter auditory phenomenon [irrelevant sound effect (ISE)] is the acoustical variation in the sound that is an inherent part of music. 
Thus, it may be possible for an unliked, unfamiliar piece of music to be less damaging to performance than liked, familiar music.
In this study, an ISE paradigm was adopted in which serial recall was performed in the presence of quiet, liked, and disliked music.
\\
25 undergraduate students.
The digits were presented visually and participants were asked to write digits down after presentation.
\\
Results: performance on quiet condition was significantly better than the disliked condition. Performance on the disliked condition was significantly better than the liked condition. 
\\
The disliked music had a `steady-state waveform' while the liked music was more variable. 
In summary, the current study's findings support that of
Perham and Vizard (2010) by once again showing that familiar, liked music impairs serial recall performance by virtue, we would argue, of the acoustical variation in the music.

\hl{Many studies report the beneficial effects of listening to
music on cognitive performance where the music is listened to before the task begins and the increase in performance is explained by participant's increase in mood and arousal (e.g. Nantais \& Schellenberg, 1999; Schellenberg \& Hallam, 2005).}},

	Abstract = {Research suggests that listening to background music prior to task performance increases cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, through the mechanism of increasing arousal and positive mood. However, music preference has not been explored with regard to a more common and realistic scenario of concurrent music and cognition, namely the `irrelevant sound effect' (ISE). To examine this, serial recall was tested under quiet, liked and disliked music sound conditions as well as steady-state (repetition of `3') and changing-state speech (random digits 1--9). Results revealed performance to be poorer for both music conditions and the changing-state speech compared to quiet and steady-state speech conditions. The lack of difference between both music conditions suggests that preference does not affect serial recall performance. These findings are discussed within the music and cognition and auditory distraction literatures.},
	Annote = {\hl{A popular explanation for this improvement in cognitive performance proposes that if the music is liked then this increases arousal which in turn increases performance (Schellenberg, 2005). However, the general methodology that this explanation refers to requires that participants listen to music prior to performing the task which may be contrary to most people's experience. That is, most people listen to music at the same time as, rather than prior to, performing the task.}

Serial recall was performed in the presence of five sound conditions: quiet, liked music, disliked music, changing- state speech and steady-state speech.
All songs had lyrics.

The task was a serial recall task - participants were presented with a series of consonants and then were asked to recall the list.

Results: performance was best in quiet and steady-state conditions. Liked, disliked, and changing-state speech showed similar impairments. 
The positive effect of music preference was not observed when listening to music during task performance.

	Abstract = {Research on the effects of background music has a long history. Early work was not embedded within a theoretical framework, was often poorly conceptualised and produced equivocal findings. This paper reports two studies exploring the effects of music, perceived to be calming and relaxing, on performance in arithmetic and on a memory task in children aged 10--12. The calming music led to better performance on both tasks when compared with a no-music condition. Music perceived as arousing, aggressive and unpleasant disrupted perform- ance on the memory task and led to a lower level of reported altruistic behaviour by the children. This suggests that the effects of music on task performance are mediated by arousal and mood rather than affecting cognition directly. The findings are discussed in relation to possible practical applications in the primary school and the home.},

When listening to music pupils answered more questions (faster rate of completion), but there was no significant difference in accuracy.

Study 2: Pupil's performance on a memory task (sentence memory) was compared during calming music, silence, and arousing (aggressive, unpleasant) music. 
Calming music had a positive effect on the memory task, and the arousing music had a negative effect.

Findings suggest that effects of music on task performance are mediated through its effects on arousal and mood.

	Abstract = {Previous research has found that introverts' performance on complex cognitive tasks is more negatively affected by distracters, e.g. music and background television, than extraverts' performance. This study extended previous research by examining whether background noise would be as distracting as music. In the presence of silence, background garage music and office noise, 38 introverts and 38 extraverts carried out a reading comprehension task, a prose recall task and a mental arithmetic task. It was predicted that there would be an interaction between personality and background sound on all three tasks: introverts would do less well on all of the tasks than extraverts in the presence of music and noise but in silence performance would be the same. A significant interaction was found on the reading comprehension task only, although a trend for this effect was clearly present on the other two tasks. It was also predicted that there would be a main effect for background sound: performance would be worse in the presence of music and noise than silence. Results confirmed this prediction. These findings support the Eysenckian hypothesis of the difference in optimum cortical arousal in introverts and extraverts.},
	Annote = {This study aimed to determine whether there would be a differential distraction of background noise and music on the cognitive test performance of introverts and extraverts on three kinds of task.
The tasks were specifically selected in order to be as ecologically valid as possible: the prose recall task relates to examination strategies at any level of education; while the reading comprehension task, which involves assimilating information, involves absorbing and understanding information and then recalling it. Finally, the mental arithmetic tasks are also often conducted in working environments, such as calculating pay and producing figures.
\hl{Only complex vocal music was used.}
The tests were completed under three conditions: silence, noise, and music.

Results: in all three tasks performance declined in the presence of music, however extraverts did better than introverts.

This study looked at how introverts/extroverts are affected by music while performing a task.
Participants completed a reading comprehension test and a memory test.
The music was a 10 minute recording of a morning ratio show - 3 songs with male talking in between. The total amount of talking time was just over 2 minutes. 
Results showed that personality type did not make a difference.
