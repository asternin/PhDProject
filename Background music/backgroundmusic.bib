	Abstract = {Although liked music is known to improve performance through boosting one's mood and arousal, both liked music and disliked music impair serial recall performance. Given that the key acoustical feature of this impairment is the acoustical variation, it is possible that some music may contain less acoustical variation and so produce less impairment. In this situation, unliked, unfamiliar music could be better for performance than liked, familiar music. This study tested this by asking participants to serially recall eight-item lists in either quiet, liked or disliked music conditions. Results showed that performance was significantly poorer in both music conditions compared with quiet. More importantly, performance in the liked music condition was significantly poorer than in the disliked music condition. These findings provide further illustration of the irrelevant sound effect and limitations of the impact of liked music on cognition.},

	Abstract = {Research suggests that listening to background music prior to task performance increases cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, through the mechanism of increasing arousal and positive mood. However, music preference has not been explored with regard to a more common and realistic scenario of concurrent music and cognition, namely the `irrelevant sound effect' (ISE). To examine this, serial recall was tested under quiet, liked and disliked music sound conditions as well as steady-state (repetition of `3') and changing-state speech (random digits 1--9). Results revealed performance to be poorer for both music conditions and the changing-state speech compared to quiet and steady-state speech conditions. The lack of difference between both music conditions suggests that preference does not affect serial recall performance. These findings are discussed within the music and cognition and auditory distraction literatures.},

@article{Hallam2002,
	Abstract = {Research on the effects of background music has a long history. Early work was not embedded within a theoretical framework, was often poorly conceptualised and produced equivocal findings. This paper reports two studies exploring the effects of music, perceived to be calming and relaxing, on performance in arithmetic and on a memory task in children aged 10--12. The calming music led to better performance on both tasks when compared with a no-music condition. Music perceived as arousing, aggressive and unpleasant disrupted perform- ance on the memory task and led to a lower level of reported altruistic behaviour by the children. This suggests that the effects of music on task performance are mediated by arousal and mood rather than affecting cognition directly. The findings are discussed in relation to possible practical applications in the primary school and the home.},

Study 1: Pupil's performance on arithmetic tasks was compared during calming music and silence.
When listening to music pupils answered more questions (faster rate of completion), but there was no significant difference in accuracy.
\\
Study 2: Pupil's performance on a memory task (sentence memory) was compared during calming music, silence, and arousing (aggressive, unpleasant) music. 
Calming music had a positive effect on the memory task, and the arousing music had a negative effect.

Findings suggest that effects of music on task performance are mediated through its effects on arousal and mood.

	Abstract = {Previous research has found that introverts' performance on complex cognitive tasks is more negatively affected by distracters, e.g. music and background television, than extraverts' performance. This study extended previous research by examining whether background noise would be as distracting as music. In the presence of silence, background garage music and office noise, 38 introverts and 38 extraverts carried out a reading comprehension task, a prose recall task and a mental arithmetic task. It was predicted that there would be an interaction between personality and background sound on all three tasks: introverts would do less well on all of the tasks than extraverts in the presence of music and noise but in silence performance would be the same. A significant interaction was found on the reading comprehension task only, although a trend for this effect was clearly present on the other two tasks. It was also predicted that there would be a main effect for background sound: performance would be worse in the presence of music and noise than silence. Results confirmed this prediction. These findings support the Eysenckian hypothesis of the difference in optimum cortical arousal in introverts and extraverts.},
	Annote = {This study aimed to determine whether there would be a differential distraction of background noise and music on the cognitive test performance of introverts and extraverts on three kinds of task.
The tasks were specifically selected in order to be as ecologically valid as possible: the prose recall task relates to examination strategies at any level of education; while the reading comprehension task, which involves assimilating information, involves absorbing and understanding information and then recalling it. Finally, the mental arithmetic tasks are also often conducted in working environments, such as calculating pay and producing figures.

The tests were completed under three conditions: silence, noise, and music.
