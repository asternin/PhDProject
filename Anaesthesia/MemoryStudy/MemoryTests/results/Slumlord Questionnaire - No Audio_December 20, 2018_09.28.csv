The man was living on people's floors at the time while looking for one. The man's friend was searching far and wide for a new apartment when suddenly his friend advises him that there was an opening in his building. His friend advised the man to bring 550$ in an envelope. When the man went to the superintendant (Bob), he said he threw down the envolope on the desk but this was interpreted as being ""rude"" by Bob. He skips over everything and says somehow he got the lease. He explains in this story how Bob is from Brazil and that Bob was a weird guy always saying things that he could do back in Brazil. Such as being able to kill a man. It wa ssupposedly written in the constitution that he couldnt get in trouble for it. Anyways, the man telling the story said he was southern and had a great relationship with old lady's in the building (specifically portoricans) because he was always at church on sunday mornings and even says that he had a perfect attendance badge from when he was a kid. He said that he felt that the old lady's were getting charged too much and the amount they paid per month was unfair. He brought this up to Bob and then Allen, the person who owned the buildings got involved. Allen was not a big fan of the mans thoughts and threatened to take them all to court includong the grandmas. The man then told Allen that there was no way he would win because there would be a ton of old lady's being mistreated in front of a judge. They end up solving the problem and everything is fine and dandy until one day the man sees a newspaper that headlined ""killer landlord"" and thought it would be interesting. He picks it up and it's about Allen. See allen had a sister that owned 2 other buildings, and allen owned 2 as well. Allen's sister was being divorced with, and by the law of New York, you lose half your belongings. So Allen's sisters husband wa sabout to receive one of the buildings. Allen didn't like this and decided to get the Husband killed before this could happen. The man then lived there for a few more years and never saw Bob again. The man had a family and kids and somehow he finds himself with a man with the last name Moscow and Moscow is involved with something with the homicides of new york. When the man tells him he lived in abuilding where that occurred, Moscow recites Allen's full name. Moscow then tells the man the full story. See, sonce Allen had the husband killed, he also decided he was going to kill off any other troublemakers that caused any type of threat towards him. Such as the people that were ritoing agaisnt him. When Bob found out, he ratted Allen out and no more killings ocurred. The joke of the story is that the man almost got himself and others killed all after this riot, and if it wasn't for weird old Bob, he might've been dead.

He had bought an apartment in new York and given the superintendent, Bob, ""key money"" of $550. Bob told him stories about how he owned 4 ranches in Brazil but the stress from them gave his heart problems. Bob's Brazilian doctor had said to grow more flesh to cover his heart. The narrator, presumably a comedian, comments that Bob had gained more flesh. Alan, his landlord, would treat the narrarator and people like him (young males) better than the old ladies that lived there.  As a Catholic southern boy who had perfect attendance for 8 years in Sunday school,. the narrarator was good with old ladies. So he got invited to an old lady's apartment and noticed that her bathtub was overflowing. So he started a rent strike with the old ladies in which he threatened to take Alan to court for treating them differently. Alan, knowing he would lose, gave in. The narrarator then passed by a newspaper stand and saw a headline saying ""terrible landlords"" and recognized his own landlord. He read the story and saw that Alan and his sister owned 4 hotels and by New York law, his brother-in-law would receive 1 hotel upon divorce. Alan did not want to lose a hotel so he hired a hitman to kill the brother-in-law. Bob found the body and told the police, putting Alan in jail. After living in the apartment for 10 years, the narrarator moved in and began work in the New York Times. He was working on an article about money laundering and called up a man named John Moscow. He asked if Moscow had evry done money-laundering and Moscow replied no but he had been involved in homicide. This fact prompted the narrarator to talk about how his landlord had been a murderer. Moscow replied, ""Alan Stein."" The narrarator then learned that Moscow was the one who had ""taken care"" of the brother-in-law. Alan had then wanted Bob to hire another hitman for the tenant activists in his building but Bob, knowing Alan would be the first suspect, did not want any implications on himself and thus ratted out Alan. The story ended off with the narrarator commenting on how Bob had saved his life.",Like somewhat,Was engaged more than half the time,No,Enter answer:,Male,,Enter answer:,the South,,,,,Enter answer:,On the table,,Enter Answer:,10 years,,Enter Answer:,4 ranches and 2 farms,,Enter Answer:,Because he cannot be persecuted under Brazilian law,,Enter answer:,Because Alan's brother-in-law would have received 1 hotel (half of his sister's property) upon divorce,,,,Alan’s sister’s ex-husband,Enter Answer:,Shot in the head and thrown under a bridge,,Enter Answer:,Through a newspaper,,Enter Answer:,"Superintendent ",,Enter Answer:,So that he would not get caught regarding the first murder,,Enter Answer:,Because he was a tenant activist,,Enter Answer:,New York Times,
