	Abstract = {Reading music and playing a musical instrument is a complex activity that comprises motor and multisensory (auditory, visual, and somatosensory) integration in a unique way. Music has also a well-known impact on the emotional state, while it can be a motivating activity. For those reasons, musical training has become a useful framework to study brain plasticity. Our aim was to study the specific effects of musical training vs. the effects of other leisure activities in elderly people. With that purpose we evaluated the impact of piano training on cognitive function, mood and quality of life (QOL) in older adults. A group of participants that received piano lessons and did daily training for 4-month (n = 13) was compared to an age-matched control group (n = 16) that participated in other types of leisure activities (physical exercise, computer lessons, painting lessons, among other). An exhaustive assessment that included neuropsychological tests as well as mood and QOL questionnaires was carried out before starting the piano program and immediately after finishing (4 months later) in the two groups. We found a significant improvement on the piano training group on the Stroop test that measures executive function, inhibitory control and divided attention. Furthermore, a trend indicating an enhancement of visual scanning and motor ability was also found (Trial Making Test part A). Finally, in our study piano lessons decreased depression, induced positive mood states, and improved the psychological and physical QOL of the elderly. Our results suggest that playing piano and learning to read music can be a useful intervention in older adults to promote cognitive reserve (CR) and improve subjective well-being.},

Objective---Intensive repetitive musical practice can lead to bilateral cortical reorganization. However, whether musical sensorimotor and cognitive abilities transfer to nonmusical cognitive abilities that are maintained throughout the life span is unclear. In an attempt to identify modifiable lifestyle factors that may potentially enhance successful aging, we evaluated the association between musical instrumental participation and cognitive aging.
\\
Method---Seventy older healthy adults (ages 60--83) varying in musical activity completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. The groups (nonmusicians, low and high activity musicians) were matched on age, education, history of physical exercise, while musicians were matched on age of instrumental acquisition and formal years of musical training. Musicians were classified in the low (1--9 years) or high (>10 years) activity group based on years of musical experience throughout their life span.
\\
Results---The results of this preliminary study revealed that participants with at least 10 years of musical experience (high activity musicians) had better performance in nonverbal memory (η2 = . 106), naming (η2 = .103), and executive processes (η2 = .131) in advanced age relative to nonmusicians. Several regression analyses evaluated how years of musical activity, age of acquisition, type of musical training, and other variables predicted cognitive performance.
\\
Conclusions---These correlational results suggest a strong predictive effect of high musical activity throughout the life span on preserved cognitive functioning in advanced age. Cognitive funcioning in advanced age is linearly related to the number of years of musical participation.},

	Abstract = {This study evaluates transfer from domain-specific, sensorimotor training to cognitive abilities associated with executive function. We examined Individualized Piano Instruction (IPI) as a potential cognitive intervention to mitigate normal age-related cognitive decline in older adults. Thirty-one musically na{\"{i}}ve community-dwelling older adults (ages 60-85) were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 16) or control group (n = 15). Neuropsychological assessments were administered at three time points: pre-training, following six months of intervention, and following a three-month delay. The experimental group significantly improved performance on the Trail Making Test and Digit Symbol measures as compared to healthy controls. Results of this study suggest that IPI may serve as an effective cognitive intervention for age-related cognitive decline.},

Music education naturally coordinates motor activity with short-term planning and long-term cognitive strategies. It is also related to intrinsic enjoyment and sense of self-esteem that stem from skilled musical performance. The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of musical instruction as a potential cognitive intervention to prevent or maintain cognitive skills in normal aging. 
\\
39 participants - healthy, older adults with less than 5 years of music experience were placed in individualized piano instruction (IPI) or control group. Cognitive testing was done pre-training, post-training (6 months), and after 3 month delay (during which no lessons or practice occurred). 
\\
Scores increased during training and during post-training interval - control group did not show such a pattern. IPI may increase cognitive abilities related to attention and concentration. Effects of IPI transfered to not musically specific cognitive domains and were sustained. However, cognitive benefits in digit span went away when practice and lessons were discontinued. },

	Abstract = {This study examines musical memory in 12 patients with moderate or severe AD and 12 healthy, older adult controls. Participants were asked to distinguish familiar from novel tunes, to identify distortions in melodies, and to sing familiar tunes. Comparison of the AD and control groups showed significant impairment of the AD participants. However, a more complex picture emerged as we compared each individual case to the control group. Five of the AD group performed within the control group range on most tasks. An additional four participants showed partial sparing in that they performed below the range of control participants, but their scores were above the level of chance. The final three participants showed near complete loss of musical memory, as their performance was consistently at or near the level of chance. These results are discussed in terms of the literature on the heterogeneity of cognitive presentation in AD.},

\\
Investigated spontaneous mental imagery (time-locked to silence). Goal: to determine when, where, and how familiarity processes occur to trigger musical imagery. 
\\
At time 1 participants listened to familiar and unknown songs, they then listened to the unknown songs for two weeks. At time 2 participants listened to same familiar songs and newly learned songs. EEG was recorded at both times during listening. Gaps of silence were randomly placed into the songs. After listening participants rated their ability to mentally complete the gaps.
\\
Time periods of stable electric configuration were first determined by segmenting together grand-mean EEG signals under the four conditions. By testing the global field power from all electrodes, the segmentation revealed TW of interest where map topography remained stable for a certain period of time and then abruptly switches to a new configuration in which it remains stable again.
9 ROIs were chosen. 
\\
Behavioural: They remained less capable of completing the gaps in learned songs than in familiar songs after a two-week learning phase.
EEG: 6 stable TWs.
ERP: N100 smaller for unknown than for familiar/newly learned (smaller MMN).
Source localization: frontal and temporal regions, and SMA.
Spectral analysis: A significant phase difference between familiar and unfamiliar songs, predominantly between 5 and 10 Hz, corresponding to both higher theta (5--7 Hz) and lower alpha (8--10 Hz) band, was observed in the central region.},

Are the memories evoked by music more vivid than the memories evoked by other stimuli?
\\
Highly familiar, popular songs were played from the time the participant was between 15-30 years old. Familiar faces were chosen based on the same age range. Participants were presented with 30 songs and 30 faces and then verbally described the memory that was evoked (if there was an autobiographical association). The description were coded and details were divided into internal (events, places, times, perceptions, emotions/thoughts) or external (semantic statemnts, repetitions, external events, other details) details. 
\\
Memory vividness was operationalized as the number of perceptual details. It was also operationalized as a higher ratio of internal to total details. 
\\
There was more vividness in the music than the face condition - larger number of perceptual details in memories evoked by music and a higher ratio of internal to total details. There were a larger number of external details in the Face condition. 
\\
More vividness could be achieved because music elicits a stronger emotional response than face pictures.
\\
An interesting question for future research will be to investigate the effects of age on autobiographical memories evoked by various cues.

Experimenters had healthy participants passively listen to familiar, unknown, and recently heard songs in 7T fMRI scanner. Also analyzed Alzheimer's disease progression using disease biomarkers: grey matter atrophy, hypometabolism, and amyloid-B deposition. Compared the ROI obtained from passive listening experiment to biomarker values. \textbf{Found musical memory ROI is relatively spared in AD.} Less Grey matter loss and hypometablism in ROI. Not true of amyloid-B deposition. 
\\
Ventral pre-SMA and the caudal anterior cingulate gyrus are crucial for encoding of long-term musical memory. They are not sensitive to autobiographical relevance of the pieces heard. 
These findings suggest that while the temporal lobes may be involved in explicit musical memory, their role in long-term musical memory processing may not be essential to maintain long-term representations of music - i.e., needed for encoding, not retrieval.
\\
Supports suggestion by Baird and Samson (2009) that mostly implicit musical memory is spared in musical memory. These results show a possible explanation for preservation after severe bilateral temporal lobe damage (like in AD) - long-term musical memory representations rely heavily on ventral pre-SMA and caudal anterior cingulate gyrus. May also give an explanation for the split betwee implicit and explicit memory (SMA vs temporal lobes)},

From a Meta-analysis: Clusters of changes in activity in various regions in response to music: nuclei in the amygdala, the hippocampal formation, right ventral striatum (including nucleus accumbens) extending into the ventral pallidum, the head of the left caudate nucleus, the audi- tory cortex, the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA), the cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Thus, music can evoke activity changes in the core brain regions that underlie emotion.
\\
The amygdala has high network centrality within emotion networks: it has high structural centrality, and is connected with several other computational hubs.
The nucleus accumbens shows activity during intense feelings of music-evoked pleasure and reward (musical frissons). 
Dopamine availability has been shown to increase in the dorsal striatum during the anticipation of a musical frisson and in the ventral striatum during the experience of the frisson.
Hippocampus is involved with music-evoked tenderness, peacefulness, joy, frissons, or sadness.

The fact that music elicits activity changes in limbic and paralimbic brain structures opens up the possibility of numerous applications for music-based therapy.},

	Abstract = {Music evoked autobiographical memories (MEAMs) have been characterised in the healthy population, but not, to date, in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI). Our aim was to investigate music compared with verbal evoked autobiographical memories. Five patients with severe ABI and matched controls completed the experimental music (MEAM) task (a written questionnaire) while listening to 50 "Number 1 Songs of the Year" (from 1960 to 2010). Patients also completed the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI) and a standard neuropsychological assessment. With the exception of Case 5, who reported no MEAMs and no autobiographical incidents on the AMI and who also had impaired pitch perception, the range of frequency and type of MEAMs in patients was broadly in keeping with their matched controls. The relative preservation of MEAMs in four cases was particularly noteworthy given their impaired verbal and/or visual anterograde memory, and in three cases, autobiographical memory impairment. The majority of MEAMs in both cases and matched controls were of a person/people or a period of life. In three patients music was more efficient at evoking autobiographical memories than the AMI verbal prompts. This is the first study of MEAMs after ABI. The findings suggest that music is an effective stimulus for eliciting autobiographical memories, and may be beneficial in the rehabilitation of autobiographical amnesia, but only in patients without a fundamental deficit in autobiographical recall memory and intact pitch perception.

	Abstract = {Brain plasticity allows the central nervous system of a given organism to cope with environmental demands. Therefore, the quality of mental processes relies partly on the interaction between the brain's physiological maturation and individual daily experiences. In this review, we focus on the neural implementation of musical expertise at both an anatomical and a functional level. We then discuss how this neural implementation can explain transfers from musical learning to a broad range of non-musical cognitive functions, including language, especially during child development. Finally, given that brain plasticity is still present in aging, we gather arguments to propose that musical practice could be a good environmental enrichment to promote cerebral and cognitive reserves, thereby reducing the deleterious effect of aging on cognitive functions.},

	Abstract = {In Alzheimer patients with a solid musical background, isolated case-reports have reported the maintenance of remarkable musical abilities despite clear difficulties in their verbal memory and linguistic functions. These reports have encouraged a number of scientists to undertake more systematic studies which would allow a rigorous approach to the analysis of musical memory in Alzheimer patients with no formal musical background. Although restricted in number, the latest data are controversial regarding preserved musical capacities in Alzheimer patients. Our current review of the literature addresses this topic and advances the hypothesis that the processes of musical memory are function of illness progression. In the earlier stages, the majority of evaluations concerned musical episodic memory and suggested a dysfunction of this memory whereas in the moderate and severe stages, musical semantic memory and implicit learning are the majority of investigations and seemed more resistant to Alzheimer disease. In summary, our current review bring to understand the memory circuits involved and highlight the necessity to adapted the investigational tools employed to conform with the severity of the signs and symptoms of progressive Alzheimer disease in order to demonstrate the preserved musical capacities.},

	Abstract = {The main objective of this paper was to examine the involuntary nature of music-evoked autobiographical memories. For this purpose, young adults, older adults, and patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) were asked to remember autobiographical events in two conditions: after being exposed to their own chosen music, and in silence. Compared to memories evoked in silence, memories evoked in the " Music" condition were found to be more specific, accompanied by more emotional content and impact on mood, and retrieved faster. In addition, these memories engaged less executive processes. Thus, with all these characteristics and the fact that they are activated by a perceptual cue (i.e., music), music-evoked autobiographic memories have all the features to be considered as involuntary memories. Our paper reveals several characteristics of music-evoked autobiographical memories in AD patients and offers a theoretical background for this phenomenon. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Findings on song perception and song production have increasingly suggested that common but partially distinct neural networks exist for processing lyrics and melody. However, the neural substrates of song recognition remain to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the neural substrates involved in the accessing "song lexicon" as corresponding to a representational system that might provide links between the musical and phonological lexicons using positron emission tomography (PET). We exposed participants to auditory stimuli consisting of familiar and unfamiliar songs presented in three ways: sung lyrics (song), sung lyrics on a single pitch (lyrics), and the sung syllable 'la' on original pitches (melody). The auditory stimuli were designed to have equivalent familiarity to participants, and they were recorded at exactly the same tempo. Eleven right-handed nonmusicians participated in four conditions: three familiarity decision tasks using song, lyrics, and melody and a sound type decision task (control) that was designed to engage perceptual and prelexical processing but not lexical processing. The contrasts (familiarity decision tasks versus control) showed no common areas of activation between lyrics and melody. This result indicates that essentially separate neural networks exist in semantic memory for the verbal and melodic processing of familiar songs. Verbal lexical processing recruited the left fusiform gyrus and the left inferior occipital gyrus, whereas melodic lexical processing engaged the right middle temporal sulcus and the bilateral temporo-occipital cortices. Moreover, we found that song specifically activated the left posterior inferior temporal cortex, which may serve as an interface between verbal and musical representations in order to facilitate song recognition.},

Whereas several studies demonstrate an overlap of core structures (Broca's area, premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule), preliminary findings are discussed that imply, if confirmed, the existence of a tonal and a phonological loop in musicians. This conclusion is based on the findings of partly differing neural networks underlying verbal and tonal WM in musicians, suggesting that functional plasticity has been induced by musical training. We further propose a strong link between production and auditory WM: data indicate that both verbal and tonal auditory WM are based on the knowledge of how to produce the to-be-remembered sounds and, therefore, that sensorimotor representations are involved in the temporary maintenance of auditory information in WM.},

The musical lexicon contains a perceptual representation system for isolated tunes, much in the same way as the mental word lexicon represents isolated words. It also contains the rules of musical syntax. The music-recognition model proposed by Peretz and Coltheart (2003) provides a functional architecture for the study of musical semantic memory. In the case of brain damage the flow of information to the musical lexicon may be selectively impaired or spared. The model also queries the relationship between memory for music and for lyrics - proposes close associative links. Thus, if memory for spoken lyrics is impaired, there still may be sufficient activation in the phonologiacal lexicon to co-acivate the musical lexicon. Lyric recognition through association. 
\\
150 controls, 50 AD patients with varying levels of dementia - they completed: familiarity decision test, familiar lyrics test, distorted tunes test, distorted lyrics test, lyrics prompt test, proverbs completion test
\\
No test was immune to the presence of dementia. 1. long-term familiarity for melody was present even at severe AD. 2. melodic distortions were detected at mild and moderate AD 3. The ability to sing a melody when prompted with lyrics was retained by some with severe AD. 4. long-term familiarity with lyrics was found even at severe AD 5. detection of grammatical distortions in the lyrics of familiary melodies and the ability to complete familiar proverbs were affected even at mild AD. 
\\
The musical lexicon as part of the music recognition system (musical semantic memory) may be spared in early to moderate AD and even in severe. },

	Abstract = {Recognizing a musical excerpt without necessarily retrieving its title typically reflects the existence of a memory system dedicated to the retrieval of musical knowledge. The functional distinction between musical and verbal semantic memory has seldom been investigated. In this fMRI study, we directly compared the musical and verbal memory of 20 nonmusicians, using a congruence task involving automatic semantic retrieval and a familiarity task requiring more thorough semantic retrieval. In the former, participants had to access their semantic store to retrieve musical or verbal representations of melodies or expressions they heard, in order to decide whether these were then given the right ending or not. In the latter, they had to judge the level of familiarity of musical excerpts and expressions. Both tasks revealed activation of the left inferior frontal and posterior middle temporal cortices, suggesting that executive and selection processes are common to both verbal and musical retrievals. Distinct patterns of activation were observed within the left temporal cortex, with musical material mainly activating the superior temporal gyrus and verbal material the middle and inferior gyri. This cortical organization of musical and verbal semantic representations could explain clinical dissociations featuring selective disturbances for musical or verbal material. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

\\
To determine the brain regions mainly involved in semantic retrieval. Used a congruence and a familiarity task. Congruence task: verbal and musical content - does the second half match the first half of the melody/proverb. These were contrasted with a perceptual reference condition (are the note sequences/syllable sequences the same)
\\
Familiarity task: rate the level of familiarity of 60 melodies and 60 expressions. Songs with lyrics were not included as well as songs that might elicit strong autobiographical memories. Tasks were completed in a 3T scanner.
\\
Musical semantic contrast bilaterally activated the STG, superior and middle TG, inferior frontal gyrus, SMA. Verbal semantic contrast revealed only left-sided activation in angular gyrus, middle and inferior temporal gyri.
Familiarity - bilateral activation to music, left activation to verbal. 
\\
Results confirm a distinction between networks responsible for musical and verbal semantic memory. 
music recognition process can be broken down into two stages: access and selection. We suggest that the left superior temporal gyrus subserves the access stage and the inferior frontal area the selection one.
Overall, our present data suggest that the temporal cortex is organized along an inferior/superior axis depending of the nature of the material being retrieved. The musical material mainly activated the superior temporal cortex, whereas the middle and inferior temporal cortex was activated by the verbal material. 
. This inferior/superior organization within the left temporal cortex could help in understanding the clinical dissociations that are observed (Piccirilli et al., 2000) and the disproportionate preservation of musical knowledge in semantic dementia contrasting with severely impaired verbal skills (Hailstone et al., 2009).},

	Abstract = {The notion that memory for music can be preserved in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has been raised by a number of case studies. In this paper, we review the current research examining musical memory in patients with AD. In keeping with models of memory described in the non-musical domain, we propose that various forms of musical memory exist, and may be differentially impaired in AD, reflecting the pattern of neuropathological changes associated with the condition. Our synthesis of this literature reveals a dissociation between explicit and implicit musical memory functions. Implicit, specifically procedural musical memory, or the ability to play a musical instrument, can be spared in musicians with AD. In contrast, explicit musical memory, or the recognition of familiar or unfamiliar melodies, is typically impaired. Thus, the notion that music is unforgettable in AD is not wholly supported. Rather, it appears that the ability to play a musical instrument may be unforgettable in some musicians with AD.},
	Annote = {REVIEW (with table describing studies)
\\
A distinction can be made between implicit and explicit musical memory, but the practical assessment of musical memory does not currently reflect these distinct memory forms. 
\\
Lesion case studies suggest existence of a memory system specialized for music that involves the temporal lobe regions. Learning and recogntion involves both left and right. Recognition mainly involves right. Imaging studies have shown involvement of the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, and frontal lobes.
Predominantly left sided activation is associated with familiar music.
\\
Non-musicians have increased activity in motor cortices (compared to pianists) when performing complex finger tasks. This may reflect the efficiency of a pianists's motor cortex. However, pianists have more secondary motor cortex activity when listening to music. These areas are typically not affected by AD pathology. 
It is likely that the nature of musical memory representations and their neural correlates differ between these two groups.
\\
There are 3 ways to assess explicit memory for familiar music: 1. familiarity judgements, 2. recall or completion task, 3. listening followed by yes/no recognition task. Recognition (explicit) is impaired in AD patients. Neural correlates of \textbf{implicit} musical memory are relatively unknown. Two forms of implicit memory have been assessed in AD patients: mere exposure effect (MEE tests liking judgements), and procedural musical memory (PMM - preserved ability to play instruments). MEE - inconsistent results, may only pe preserved in early stages of AD.  PMM - even in severe AD the ability to play an instrument can be preserved.
\\
\hl{Hypothesis that dementia is less common among musicians than the regular population}
\\
Music seems to have a facilitatory effect, but methodological rigour is lacking in studies that investigate this issue (music therapy studies). Enhanced autobiographical recall associated with music listening may be due to the emotional and/or arousal effects of the music. Considering differences between musicians and non-musicians will be important in researching this isue. It is also important to consider other dementias. },

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We can easily recognize familiar music by listening to only one or 2 of its opening bars, but the brain regions that participate in this cognitive processing remain undetermined. We used positron-emission tomography (PET) to study changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) that occur during listening to familiar music. METHODS: We used a PET subtraction technique to elucidate the brain regions associated with the recognition of familiar melodies such as well-known nursery tunes. Nonmusicians performed 2 kinds of musical tasks: judging the familiarity of musical pieces (familiarity task) and detecting deliberately altered notes in the pieces (alteration-detecting task). RESULTS: During the familiarity task, bilateral anterior portions of bilateral temporal lobes, superior temporal regions, and parahippocampal gyri were activated. The alteration-detecting task bilaterally activated regions in the precunei, superior/inferior parietal lobules, and lateral surface of frontal lobes, which seemed to show a correlation with the analysis of music. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that during the familiarity task, activated brain regions participate in retrieval from long-term memory and verbal and emotional processing of familiar melodies. Our results reinforced the hypothesis reported in the literature as a result of group and case studies, that temporal lobe regions participate in the recognition of familiar melodies.},

	Abstract = {Despite intriguing and suggestive clinical observations, no formal research has assessed the possible sparing of musical recognition and memory in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). A case study is presented of an 84-year old woman with severe cognitive impairment implicating AD, but for whom music recognition and memory, according to her caregivers, appeared to be spared. The hypotheses addressed were, first, that memory for familiar music may be spared in dementia, and second, that musical recognition and memory may be reliably assessed with existing tests if behavioral observation is employed to overcome the problem of verbal or written communication. Our hypotheses were stimulated by the patient EN, for whom diagnosis of AD became probable in 2000. With severe problems in memory, language, and cognition, she now has a mini-mental status score of 8 (out of 30) and is unable to understand or recall standard instructions. In order to assess her music recognition abilities, three tests from the previous literature were adapted for behavioral observation. Two tests involved the discrimination of familiar melodies from unfamiliar melodies. The third involved the detection of distortions ("wrong" notes) in familiar melodies and discrimination of distorted melodies from melodies correctly reproduced. Test melodies were presented to EN on a CD player and her responses were observed by two test administrators. EN responded to familiar melodies by singing along, usually with the words, and often continuing to sing after the stimulus had stopped. She never responded to the unfamiliar melodies. She responded to distorted melodies with facial expressions - surprise, laughter, a frown, or an exclamation, "Oh, dear!"; she never responded in this way to the undistorted melodies. Allowing these responses as indicators of detection, the results for EN were in the normal or near normal range of scores for elderly controls. As well, lyrics to familiar melodies, spoken in a conversational voice without rhythmic or pitch clues, often prompted EN to sing the tune that correctly accompanied the lyrics. EN's results provide encouraging support for our hypotheses that sparing of musical memory may be a feature of some forms of dementia and that it may be reliably and quantitatively assessed through behavioral observation. The contrast between EN's response to music and her mini-mental status is dramatic. The article concludes with several considerations why music may be preserved in dementia and suggestions to guide future research. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

\\
In AD, the earliest spectral changes at rest are an increase in theta activity, accompanied by a decrease in beta activity, which are followed by a decrease in alpha activity. Delta frequency increases later during the course of the disease.
Studies have shown that EEG interhemispheric coherence at rest decreases with age, and patients with AD have further reductions in alpha and delta band coherence (at rest).
Objective: To examine memory-related EEG power and coherence over temporal and central recording sites in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal controls. 
\\
Participants: 10 patients with mild AD with a matched control group
Method: EEG was recorded from central (Fz, Cz and Pz) and temporal (T3 and T4) electrodes while ten very mild AD patients and ten controls performed a Sternberg-type memory scanning task with three levels of working memory load. Spectral power in delta (0--3 Hz), theta (3--5 Hz), lower alpha1 (5--7 Hz), lower alpha2 (7--9 Hz), upper alpha (9--11 Hz) and beta (15--30 Hz) was averaged for temporal and central electrodes. Coherence was averaged between central electrodes, between central and right temporal electrodes and between central and left temporal electrodes. 
\\
Results: While behavioral performance of very mild AD patients did not differ significantly from that of normal controls, findings suggest that normal controls but not AD patients respond to memory demands by increasing upper alpha power over temporal cortex. When compared with normal controls, AD patients had reduced upper alpha coherence between central and right temporal cortex.
\\
Discussion: Results are consistent with previous research on the role of upper alpha in semantic memory and suggest that very mild AD may inhibit selective synchronization of upper alpha in temporal lobes.},
