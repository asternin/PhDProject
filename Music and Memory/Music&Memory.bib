	Abstract = {Successful recognition of a familiar tune depends on a selection procedure that takes place in a memory system that contains all the representations of the specific musical phrases to which one has been exposed during one's lifetime. We refer to this memory system as the musical lexicon. The goal of the study was to identify its neural correlates. The brains of students with little musical training were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while the student listened to familiar musical themes, unfamiliar music, and random tones. The familiar themes were selected from instrumental pieces well-known to the participants; the unfamiliar music was the retrograde version of the familiar themes, which the participants did not recognize; and the random sequences contained the same musical tones but in a random order. All stimuli were synthesized and played with the sound of a piano, thereby keeping low-level acoustical factors similar across conditions. The comparison of cerebral responses to familiar versus unfamiliar music reveals focal activation in the right superior temporal sulcus (STS). Re-analysis of the data obtained in a previous study by Plailly et al. also points to the STS as the critical region involved in musical memories. The neuroimaging data further suggest that these auditory memories are tightly coupled with action (singing), by showing left activation in the planum temporale, in the supplementary motor area (SMA), and in the inferior frontal gyrus. Such a cortical organization of music recognition is analogous to the dorsal stream model of speech processing proposed by Hickok and Poeppel.},

	Abstract = {Autobiographical memory retrieval is associated with activity of a distributed network that is similar to the default-mode network (DMN) identified via activity correlations measured during rest. We tested whether activity correlations could be used to identify the autobiographical net-work during extended bouts of retrieval. Global-correlativity analysis identified regions with activity correlation differences between autobiographical-retrieval and resting states. Increased correlations were identified for retrieval versus resting states within a distributed network that included regions prototypical for autobiographical memory. This network segregated into two subnetworks comprised of regions related to memory versus cognitive control, suggesting greater functional segregation during autobiographical retrieval than rest. DMN regions were important drivers of these effects, with increased correlations between DMN and non-DMN regions and segregation of the DMN into distinct subnetworks during retrieval. Thus, the autobiographical network can be robustly identified via activity correlations and retrieval is associated with network functional organization distinct from rest.},

	Abstract = {We investigated neural correlates of retrieval success for music memory using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. To minimize the interference from MRI scan noise, we used sparse temporal sampling technique. Newly composed music materials were employed as stimuli, which enabled us to detect regions in absence of effects of experience with the music stimuli in this study. Whole brain analyses demonstrated significant retrieval success activities in the right hippocampus, bilateral lateral temporal regions, left inferior frontal gyrus and left precuneus. Anatomically defined region-of-interests analyses showed that the activity of the right hippocampus was stronger than that of the left, while the activities of the inferior frontal gyri showed the reverse pattern. Furthermore, performance-based analyses demonstrated that the retrieval success activity of the right hippocampus was positively correlated with the corrected recognition rate, suggesting that the right hippocampus contributes to the accuracy of music retrieval outcome. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Several studies of semantic memory in non-musical domains involving recognition of items from long-term memory have shown an age-related shift from the medial temporal lobe structures to the frontal lobe. However, the effects of aging on musical semantic memory remain unexamined. We compared activation associated with recognition of familiar melodies in younger and older adults. Recognition follows successful retrieval from the musical lexicon that comprises a lifetime of learned musical phrases. We used the sparse-sampling technique in fMRI to determine the neural correlates of melody recognition by comparing activation when listening to familiar versus unfamiliar melodies, and to identify age differences. Recognition-related cortical activation was detected in the right superior temporal, bilateral inferior and superior frontal, left middle orbitofrontal, bilateral precentral, and left supramarginal gyri. Region-of-interest analysis showed greater activation for younger adults in the left superior temporal gyrus and for older adults in the left superior frontal, left angular, and bilateral superior parietal regions. Our study provides powerful evidence for these musical memory networks due to a large sample (N = 40) that includes older adults. This study is the first to investigate the neural basis of melody recognition in older adults and to compare the findings to younger adults.},

However, these results were essentially obtained with verbal and visuospatial material. The aim of this work was to determine the neural substrates underlying the semantic and episodic components of music using familiar and nonfamiliar melodic tunes. To study musical semantic memory, we designed a task in which the instruction was to judge whether or not the musical extract was felt as "familiar." To study musical episodic memory, we constructed two delayed recognition tasks, one containing only familiar and the other only nonfamiliar items.

First, regarding the episodic memory condition, bilateral activations of the middle and superior frontal gyri and precuneus (more prominent on the right side) were observed. Second, the semantic memory condition disclosed extensive activations in the medial and orbital frontal cortex bilaterally, the left angular gyrus, and predominantly the left anterior part of the middle temporal gyri.

	Abstract = {The distinction between episodic and semantic memory has become very popular since it was first proposed by Tulving in 1972. So far, very few neuropsychological, psychophysical, and imaging studies have related to the mnemonic aspects of music, notably on the long-term memory features, and practically nothing is known about the functional anatomy of long-term memory for music. Numerous functional imaging studies have shown that retrieval from semantic and episodic memory is subserved by distinct neural networks. For instance, the HERA model (hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry) ascribes to the left prefrontal cortex a preferential role in the encoding process of episodic material and the recall of semantic information, while the right prefrontal cortex would preferentially operate in the recall of episodic information. However, these results were essentially obtained with verbal and visuo-spatial material. We have done a study to determine the neural substrates underlying the semantic and episodic components of music using familiar and nonfamiliar melodic tunes. Two distinct patterns of activations were found: bilateral activation of the middle and superior frontal areas and precuneus for episodic memory, and activation of the medial and orbital frontal cortex bilaterally, left angular gyrus, and the anterior part of the left middle and superior temporal gyri for semantic memory. We discuss these findings in light of the available neuropsychological data obtained in brain-damaged subjects and functional neuroimaging studies.},

	Abstract = {The importance of music in our daily life has given rise to an increased number of studies addressing the brain regions involved in its appreciation. Some of these studies controlled only for the familiarity of the stimuli, while others relied on pleasantness ratings, and others still on musical preferences. With a listening test and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we wished to clarify the role of familiarity in the brain correlates of music appreciation by controlling, in the same study, for both familiarity and musical preferences. First, we conducted a listening test, in which participants rated the familiarity and liking of song excerpts from the pop/rock repertoire, allowing us to select a personalized set of stimuli per subject. Then, we used a passive listening paradigm in fMRI to study music appreciation in a naturalistic condition with increased ecological value. Brain activation data revealed that broad emotion-related limbic and paralimbic regions as well as the reward circuitry were significantly more active for familiar relative to unfamiliar music. Smaller regions in the cingulate cortex and frontal lobe, including the motor cortex and Broca's area, were found to be more active in response to liked music when compared to disliked one. Hence, familiarity seems to be a crucial factor in making the listeners emotionally engaged with music, as revealed by fMRI data.},

	Abstract = {People can experience different emotions when listening to music. A growing number of studies have investigated the brain structures and neural connectivities associated with perceived emotions. However, very little is known about the effect of an explicit act of judgement on the neural processing of emotionally-valenced music. In this study, we adopted the novel consensus clustering paradigm, called binarisation of consensus partition matrices (Bi-CoPaM), to study whether and how the conscious aesthetic evaluation of the music would modulate brain connectivity networks related to emotion and reward processing. Participants listened to music under three conditions -- one involving a non-evaluative judgment, one involving an explicit evaluative aesthetic judgment, and one involving no judgement at all (passive listening only). During non-evaluative attentive listening we obtained auditory-limbic connectivity whereas when participants were asked to decide explicitly whether they liked or disliked the music excerpt, only two clusters of intercommunicating brain regions were found: one including areas related to auditory processing and action observation, and the other comprising higher-order structures involved with visual processing. Results indicate that explicit evaluative judgment has an impact on the neural auditory-limbic connectivity during affective processing of music.},

	Abstract = {Polyphonic music combines multiple auditory streams to create complex auditory scenes, thus providing a tool for investigating the neural mechanisms that orient attention in natural auditory contexts. Across two fMRI experiments, we varied stimuli and task demands in order to identify the cortical areas that are activated during attentive listening to real music. In individual experiments and in a conjunction analysis of the two experiments, we found bilateral blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal increases in temporal (the superior temporal gyrus), parietal (the intraparietal sulcus), and frontal (the precentral sulcus, the inferior frontal sulcus and gyrus, and the frontal operculum) areas during selective and global listening, as compared with passive rest without musical stimulation. Direct comparisons of the listening conditions showed significant differences between attending to single timbres (instruments) and attending across multiple instruments, although the patterns that were observed depended on the relative demands of the tasks being compared. The overall pattern of BOLD signal increases indicated that attentive listening to music recruits neural circuits underlying multiple forms of working memory, attention, semantic processing, target detection, and motor imagery. Thus, attentive listening to music appears to be enabled by areas that serve general functions, rather than by music-specific cortical modules.},

Subjects either imagined the continuation of nonverbal tunes cued by their first few notes, listened to a short sequence of notes as a control task, or listened and then reimagined that short sequence. Subtraction of the activation in the control task from that in the real-tune imagery task revealed primarily right-sided activation in frontal and superior temporal regions, plus supple- mentary motor area (SMA). Isolating retrieval of the real tunes by subtracting activation in the reimagine task from that in the real-tune imagery task revealed activation primarily in right frontal areas and right superior temporal gyrus. Subtraction of activation in the control condition from that in the reimagine condition, intended to capture imagery of unfamiliar sequences, revealed activation in SMA, plus some left frontal regions. We conclude that areas of right auditory association cortex, together with right and left frontal cortices, are implicated in imagery for familiar tunes, in accord with previous behavioral, lesion and PET data. Retrieval from musical semantic memory is mediated by structures in the right frontal lobe, in contrast to results from previous studies implicating left frontal areas for all semantic retrieval. The SMA seems to be involved specifically in image generation, implicating a motor code in this process},

Another aim was to test whether activity in supplementary motor area (SMA) seen in prior studies might have been related to subvocalization. Participants with moderate musical background were scanned while making similarity judgments about the timbre of heard or imagined musical instrument sounds. The critical control condition was a visual imagery task. The pattern of judgments in perceived and imagined conditions was similar, suggesting that perception and imagery access similar cognitive representations of timbre. As expected, judgments of heard timbres, relative to the visual imagery control, activated primary and secondary auditory areas with some right-sided asymmetry. Timbre imagery also activated secondary auditory areas relative to the visual imagery control, although less strongly, in accord with previous data. Significant overlap was observed in these regions between perceptual and imagery conditions. Because the visual control task resulted in deactivation of auditory areas relative to a silent baseline, we interpret the timbre imagery effect as a reversal of that deactivation. Despite the lack of an obvious subvocalization component to timbre imagery, some activity in SMA was observed, suggesting that SMA may have a more general role in imagery beyond any motor component.},

Here, we addressed the hypothesis that previous music training is related to improved working memory. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) and a standardized test of working memory, we investigated both neural and behavioral aspects of working memory in college-aged, non-professional musicians and non-musicians. Behaviorally, musicians outperformed non-musicians on standardized subtests of visual, phonological, and executive memory. ERPs were recorded in standard auditory and visual oddball paradigms (participants responded to infrequent deviant stimuli embedded in lists of standard stimuli). Electrophysiologically, musicians demonstrated faster updating of working memory (shorter latency P300s) in both the auditory and visual domains and musicians allocated more neural resources to auditory stimuli (larger amplitude P300), showing increased sensitivity to the auditory standard/deviant difference and less effortful updating of auditory working memory. These findings demonstrate that long-term music training is related to improvements in working memory, in both the auditory and visual domains and in terms of both behavioral and ERP measures. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Songs naturally bind lyrics and melody into a unified representation. Using a subsequent memory paradigm, we examined the neural processes associated with binding lyrics and melodies during song encoding. Participants were presented with songs in two conditions: a unified condition (melodies sung with lyrics), and a separate condition (melodies sung with the syllable "la"). In both cases, written lyrics were displayed and participants were instructed to memorize them by repeating them covertly or by generating mental images of the songs. We expected the unified condition to recruit the posterior superior temporal gyrus, known to be involved in perceptual integration of songs, as well as the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Conversely, we hypothesized that the separate condition would engage a larger network including the hippocampus to bind lyrics and melodies of songs, and the basal ganglia and the cerebellum to ensure the correct sequence coupling of verbal and musical information in time. Binding lyrics and melodies in the unified condition revealed activation of the left IFG, bilateral middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and left motor cortex, suggesting a strong linguistic processing for this condition. Binding in the separate compared to the unified condition revealed greater activity in the right hippocampus as well as other areas including the left caudate, left cerebellum, and right IFG. This study provides novel evidence for the role of the right hippocampus in binding lyrics and melodies in songs. Results are discussed in light of studies of binding in the visual domain and highlight the role of regions involved in timing and synchronization such as the basal ganglia and the cerebellum.},

To examine the contribution of the medial temporal lobe to musical preference and recognition, we tested patients with either left (LTL) or right (RTL) temporal lobe lesions as well as normal control (NC) participants using the procedure of Peretz et al. The results in the affect task showed that NC and LTL participants preferred the studied over nonstudied melodies, thereby demonstrating an implicit exposure effect on liking judgments, whereas RTL patients failed to exhibit this effect. Explicit recognition was impaired in both LTL and RTL patients as compared to NC participants. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that RTL structures play a critical role in the formation of melody representations that support both priming and memory recognition, whereas LTL structures are more involved in the explicit retrieval of melodies. Furthermore, we were able to test an amnesic patient (PC) with bilateral lesions of the temporal lobe. In this case, the exposure effect on liking was also absent. However, repeated exposure to melodies was found to enhance both liking and recognition judgments. This remarkable sparing of memory observed through melody repetition suggests that extensive exposure may assist both implicit and explicit memory in the presence of global amnesia.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A follow-up study of a patient, C.N., with a severe auditory agnosia limited to music is reported. After bilateral temporal lobe damage, C.N., whose cognitive and speech functions are otherwise normal, is totally unable to identify or to experience a sense of familiarity with musical excerpts that were once highly familiar to her. However, she can recognize the lyrics that usually accompany the songs. She can also identify familiar sounds, such as animal cries. Thus, her agnosia appears highly specific to music. The functional nature of her deficit has been investigated through various perceptual tasks. She was initially severely impaired in processing pitch sequential structure but has always enjoyed normal processing of temporal structure. This selective disturbance for sequential pitch information can hardly account for her tune agnosia since processing of pitch variations has dramatically improved over the years. This recovery was not accompanied by any signs of improvement in music recognition, which remains extremely poor. Moreover, the fact that she has never been able to hum tunes from memory argues for a basic memory disturbance. Thus, she was tested here with a series of tests aiming at assessing her memory for familiar and unfamiliar music. The results show that C.N. has now recovered most perceptual skills and that despite a transient ability to exhibit knowledge of familiar music under restricted circumstances, she is markedly impaired at naming a tune and at judging its familiarity, as well as at memorizing familiar as well as novel music. This deficit was found to be not only modality-specific but music-specific as well. The findings suggest the existence of a perceptual memory that is specialized for music and that can be selectively damaged so as to prevent most forms of recognition ability.},

The melody of a song, in some situations, can facilitate learning and recall. The experiments in this article demonstrate that text is better recalled when it is heard as a song rather than as speech, provided the music repeats so that it is easily learned. When Ss heard 3 verses of a text sung with the same melody, they had better recall than when the same text was spoken. However, the opposite occurred when Ss heard a single verse of a text sung or when Ss heard different melodies for each verse of a song; in these instances, Ss had better recall when the text was spoken. Furthermore, the experiments indicate that the melody contributes more than just rhythmical information. Music is a rich structure that chunks words and phrases, identifies line lengths, identifies stress patterns, and adds emphasis as well as focuses listeners on surface characteristics. The musical structure can assist in learning, in retrieving, and if necessary, in reconstructing a text.},

	Abstract = {Middle-aged and elderly subjects heard melody- and title-cues for popular songs dating from 1921 to 1974. Subjects made familiarity and time-of-popularity judgments, and, when a cue was recognized, they attempted lyric recall and estimated when the song was last heard. Two findings indicate that performance was based on very long term memory: Middle-aged subjects made relatively few recognition responses to songs from the twenties and thirties (when they were unborn or very young) while older subjects did not show this trend, and the last-heard judgments of all subjects were highly correlated with actual year-of-popularity. The major findings were that (a) cued recall of lyrics was higher in response to melodies than in response to titles, while temporal judgments showed no effect of cue and (b) temporal placement of a song was more accurate when recognized than when not recognized, even when lyrics were not recalled. The results suggest that accurate lifespan memory for popular songs exists, and that temporal judgments are based on episodic memory for information at least partially independent of lyric representations.},

	Abstract = {To study emotional reactions to music, it is important to consider the temporal dynamics of both affective responses and underlying brain activity. Here, we investigated emotions induced by music using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a data-driven approach based on intersubject correlations (ISC). This method allowed us to identify moments in the music that produced similar brain activity (i.e. synchrony) among listeners under relatively natural listening conditions. Continuous ratings of subjective pleasantness and arousal elicited by the music were also obtained for the music outside of the scanner. Our results reveal synchronous activations in left amygdala, left insula and right caudate nucleus that were associated with higher arousal, whereas positive valence ratings correlated with decreases in amygdala and caudate activity. Additional analyses showed that synchronous amygdala responses were driven by energy-related features in the music such as root mean square and dissonance, while synchrony in insula was additionally sensitive to acoustic event density. Intersubject synchrony also occurred in the left nucleus accumbens, a region critically implicated in reward processing. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of an approach based on ISC to explore the temporal dynamics of music perception and emotion in naturalistic conditions.},

	Abstract = {The interpretation of human consciousness from brain activity, without recourse to speech or action, is one of the most provoking and challenging frontiers of modern neuroscience. We asked whether there is a common neural code that underpins similar conscious experiences, which could be used to decode these experiences in the absence of behavior. To this end, we used richly evocative stimulation (an engaging movie) portraying real-world events to elicit a similar conscious experience in different people. Common neural correlates of conscious experience were quantified and related to measurable, quantitative and qualitative, executive components of the movie through two additional behavioral investigations. The movie's executive demands drove synchronized brain activity across healthy participants' frontal and parietal cortices in regions known to support executive function. Moreover, the timing of activity in these regions was predicted by participants' highly similar qualitative experience of the movie's moment-to-moment executive demands, suggesting that synchronization of activity across participants underpinned their similar experience. Thus we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that a neural index based on executive function reliably predicted every healthy individual's similar conscious experience in response to real-world events unfolding over time. This approach provided strong evidence for the conscious experience of a brain-injured patient, who had remained entirely behaviorally nonresponsive for 16 y. The patient's executive engagement and moment-to-moment perception of the movie content were highly similar to that of every healthy participant. These findings shed light on the common basis of human consciousness and enable the interpretation of conscious experience in the absence of behavior.},

Are new lyrics better learned and memorized when presented in a spoken or sung form?
In normal young adults, mixed results have been reported, with studies showing a positive, a negative, or a null effect of singing on verbal recall. 
This may be because of differences in familiarity or learning sessions (successive vs long-term retention).
These two factors are considered here in a hl{case study} of a participant who suffers from mild Alzheimer's disease. As expected, initial learning of new lyrics showed better performance for the spoken condition over the sung version unless the lyrics are learned on a familiar melody. After repeated learning episodes, learning sung lyrics -- even on an unfamiliar melody -- led to better retention of words. Thus, music may provide a more robust aid for consolidation in memory than spoken lyrics alone. },

	Abstract = {Musical mnemonics have a long and diverse history of popular use. In addition, music processing in general is often considered spared by the neurodegenerative effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research examining these two phenomena is limited, and no work to our knowledge has explored the effectiveness of musical mnemonics in AD. The present study sought to investigate the effect of music at encoding on the subsequent recognition of associated verbal information. Lyrics of unfamiliar children's songs were presented bimodally at encoding, and visual stimuli were accompanied by either a sung or a spoken recording. Patients with AD demonstrated better recognition accuracy for the sung lyrics than the spoken lyrics, while healthy older adults showed no significant difference between the two conditions. We propose two possible explanations for these findings: first, that the brain areas subserving music processing may be preferentially spared by AD, allowing a more holistic encoding that facilitates recognition, and second, that music heightens arousal in patients with AD, allowing better attention and improved memory. ?? 2010.},

The present study sought to investigate the effect of music at encoding on the subsequent recognition of associated verbal information. Lyrics of unfamiliar children's songs were presented bimodally at encoding, and visual stimuli were accompanied by either a sung or a spoken recording. Patients with AD demonstrated better recognition accuracy for the sung lyrics than the spoken lyrics, while healthy older adults showed no significant difference between the two conditions.
\\
Main effect of group - healthy adults performed better overall, but AD patients performed better with music
\\
Are musical brain areas spared in AD? does music heighten arousal in patients with AD, allowing better attention/improved memory?},

All patients showed profound deficit in episodic memory, while minimal, mild, and moderate AD resulted in heterogenous deficits in semantic memory. 
\\
These data are in keeping with recent neuropathological studies demonstrating that the transentorhinal region is consistently involved at a very early stage. Lesions in this site cause a functional disconnection of the hippocampus, and hence a profound episodic memory disorder. The fact that many, but not all, patients with early disease also show impairment of semantic memory suggests that damage to the transentorhinal region is not sufficient to produce significant disruption of semantic memory. Such disruption reliably occurs, we hypothesize, only when the pathology extends to the temporal neocortex proper,},

The main aim of the study was to assess melodic and temporal perception of music and musical memory in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD, compared with age-matched healthy controls. 
Hypothesized that there would be more musical memory and perceptual deficits in patients.
\\
music abilities were assessed using the complete version of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA). 3 tasks - are patients able to distinguish pitch changes in melodies. 3 tasks - ability to discriminate rhythmic changes, meter, and memory. Memory is tested using an incidental memory task (Episodic memory - The subjects are asked to distinguish 15 melodies heard during the previous tasks from other completely novel melodies by stating whether they have or have not heard them before)
\\
Patients scored significantly lower in all MBEA tasks than controls. 76.6% of patients displayed an impairment in melodic discrimination. 52.4% of patients obtained normal scores on rhythm processing task. 
The melodic and the temporal systems for processing music are affected differently in AD.
Melodic information impairment is much more severe then temporal information impairment. May have to do with the structures involved in these systems and the order in which atrophy occurs in AD. 
\\
Musical memory does not appear to have been affected by musical perception defects. Musical perception deficits could be unrelated to memory deficits. },

Objective---Intensive repetitive musical practice can lead to bilateral cortical reorganization. However, whether musical sensorimotor and cognitive abilities transfer to nonmusical cognitive abilities that are maintained throughout the life span is unclear. In an attempt to identify modifiable lifestyle factors that may potentially enhance successful aging, we evaluated the association between musical instrumental participation and cognitive aging.
\\
Method---Seventy older healthy adults (ages 60--83) varying in musical activity completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. The groups (nonmusicians, low and high activity musicians) were matched on age, education, history of physical exercise, while musicians were matched on age of instrumental acquisition and formal years of musical training. Musicians were classified in the low (1--9 years) or high (>10 years) activity group based on years of musical experience throughout their life span.
\\
Results---The results of this preliminary study revealed that participants with at least 10 years of musical experience (high activity musicians) had better performance in nonverbal memory (η2 = . 106), naming (η2 = .103), and executive processes (η2 = .131) in advanced age relative to nonmusicians. Several regression analyses evaluated how years of musical activity, age of acquisition, type of musical training, and other variables predicted cognitive performance.
\\
Conclusions---These correlational results suggest a strong predictive effect of high musical activity throughout the life span on preserved cognitive functioning in advanced age. Cognitive funcioning in advanced age is linearly related to the number of years of musical participation.},

Music education naturally coordinates motor activity with short-term planning and long-term cognitive strategies. It is also related to intrinsic enjoyment and sense of self-esteem that stem from skilled musical performance. The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of musical instruction as a potential cognitive intervention to prevent or maintain cognitive skills in normal aging. 
\\
39 participants - healthy, older adults with less than 5 years of music experience were placed in individualized piano instruction (IPI) or control group. Cognitive testing was done pre-training, post-training (6 months), and after 3 month delay (during which no lessons or practice occurred). 
\\
Scores increased during training and during post-training interval - control group did not show such a pattern. IPI may increase cognitive abilities related to attention and concentration. Effects of IPI transfered to not musically specific cognitive domains and were sustained. However, cognitive benefits in digit span went away when practice and lessons were discontinued. },

Investigated spontaneous mental imagery (time-locked to silence). Goal: to determine when, where, and how familiarity processes occur to trigger musical imagery. 
\\
At time 1 participants listened to familiar and unknown songs, they then listened to the unknown songs for two weeks. At time 2 participants listened to same familiar songs and newly learned songs. EEG was recorded at both times during listening. Gaps of silence were randomly placed into the songs. After listening participants rated their ability to mentally complete the gaps.
\\
Time periods of stable electric configuration were first determined by segmenting together grand-mean EEG signals under the four conditions. By testing the global field power from all electrodes, the segmentation revealed TW of interest where map topography remained stable for a certain period of time and then abruptly switches to a new configuration in which it remains stable again.
9 ROIs were chosen. 
\\
Behavioural: They remained less capable of completing the gaps in learned songs than in familiar songs after a two-week learning phase.

ERP: N100 smaller for unknown than for familiar/newly learned (smaller MMN).

Are the memories evoked by music more vivid than the memories evoked by other stimuli?
\\
Highly familiar, popular songs were played from the time the participant was between 15-30 years old. Familiar faces were chosen based on the same age range. Participants were presented with 30 songs and 30 faces and then verbally described the memory that was evoked (if there was an autobiographical association). The description were coded and details were divided into internal (events, places, times, perceptions, emotions/thoughts) or external (semantic statemnts, repetitions, external events, other details) details. 
\\
Memory vividness was operationalized as the number of perceptual details. It was also operationalized as a higher ratio of internal to total details. 
\\
There was more vividness in the music than the face condition - larger number of perceptual details in memories evoked by music and a higher ratio of internal to total details. There were a larger number of external details in the Face condition. 
\\
More vividness could be achieved because music elicits a stronger emotional response than face pictures.
\\
An interesting question for future research will be to investigate the effects of age on autobiographical memories evoked by various cues.

For familiar music, AD patients had more activated areas than control subjects. For unfamiliar music, control subjects had more activated areas than AD subjects. However, only one investigated area was significantly differently activated between the 2 groups. This area was the temporopolar area, and it was significantly more active in controls than in AD subjects during unfamiliar music.},

Functional brain imaging studies have highlighted the significance of right-lateralized temporal, frontal and parietal brain areas for memory for melodies. The present study investigated the involvement of bilateral posterior parietal cortices (PPCs) for the recognition memory of melodies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). 
\\
Participants performed a recognition task before and after tDCS. The task included an encoding phase (12 melodies), a retention period, as well as a recognition phase (24 melodies). Experiment 1 revealed that anodal tDCS over the right PPC led to a deterioration of overall memory performance compared with sham. Experiment 2 confirmed the results of Experiment 1 and further showed that anodal tDCS over the left PPC did not show a modulatory effect on memory task performance, indicating a right lateralization for musical memory. Furthermore, both experiments revealed that the decline in memory for melodies can be traced back to an interference of anodal stimulation on the recollection process (remember judgements) rather than to familiarity judgements. 
\\
Taken together, this study revealed a causal involvement of the right PPC for memory for melodies and demonstrated a key role for this brain region in the recollection process of the memory task.},

Experimenters had healthy participants passively listen to familiar, unknown, and recently heard songs in 7T fMRI scanner.

Compared the ROI obtained from passive listening experiment to biomarker values. \textbf{Found musical memory ROI is relatively spared in AD.} Less Grey matter loss and hypometablism in ROI. Not true of amyloid-B deposition. 
\\
Ventral pre-SMA and the caudal anterior cingulate gyrus are crucial for encoding of long-term musical memory. They are not sensitive to autobiographical relevance of the pieces heard. 
These findings suggest that while the temporal lobes may be involved in explicit musical memory, their role in long-term musical memory processing may not be essential to maintain long-term representations of music - i.e., needed for encoding, not retrieval.
\\
Supports suggestion by Baird and Samson (2009) that mostly implicit musical memory is spared in musical memory. These results show a possible explanation for preservation after severe bilateral temporal lobe damage (like in AD) - long-term musical memory representations rely heavily on ventral pre-SMA and caudal anterior cingulate gyrus. May also give an explanation for the split betwee implicit and explicit memory (SMA vs temporal lobes)},

Interested in examining the effect of music on memory of words by contrasting performance on words learned with a melody to words learned in the context of a movie (visual) clip (texts were spoken and associated with a silent movie sequence).
Tested healthy controls and patients with mild AD.
Based on previous literature - there is likely to be a detrimental effect in the encoding phase (short term), but a positive effect of music on verbal learning during retrieval (long-term - in this study 5min).
\\
METHODS: 12 patients and 12 healthy controls. 
Using a pilot test they chose Ode to Joy as the familiar melody and Modern Time by Charlie Chaplin as the familiar movie. 
Three texts were written and recorded - one spoken only, one spoken with movie, one sung with ode to joy.
Participants read along with the recordings - asked to memorize to recall the text later. 
Line-by-line memorization method allowed for scoring of how easily participants memorized texts under three conditions.
After 5 minutes participants were asked to free recall texts - score = percentage of words accurately recalled.
\\
RESULTS: healthy controls encoded more lines than patients with better encoding occurring in musical association than other 2 conditions. Movie association was better than words alone. 
In immediate recall: All participants recalled a higher percentage of words in the musical association condition than the other 2 conditions.
In delayed recall: healthy controls recalled higher percentage of words than patients - main effect due to higher recall in musical condition than other 2 conditions. 
Looking at individual patients: generally learned more lines and recalled more words in the musical than in the other 2 conditions. 
Significant correlation between patient's working memory and delayed free recall with music.
\\
DISCUSSION: main results showed that a musical association during the encoding stage facilitates learning and retention in AD. This advantage is enhanced by music.
The benefit of music is robust and was observed in more than 90% of the AD sample on all three measures (number of lines learned, immediate and delayed recall).
In contrast to other studies they found that music helps in the encoding phase (short-term) as well as the retrieval phase (long-term).
Music may play a facilitating role by providing a richer context for encoding.
\hl{Future studies are needed to better understand how patients' working memory performance may be linked to musical mnemonics strategies. It could be particularly interesting to assess short-term feature binding abilities and how they may be related to the benefit of music on verbal learning.}
\\
There is hippocampal atrophy in AD and hippocampal sclerosis has been shown to weaken lyric/melody integration.
This could explain why AD patients don't benefit from music as much as controls. 
\hl{Could investigate the role of the hippocampas in lyric/melody integration. Investigate lyric/melody integration in AD.}},

Investigated the effect of singing training on the cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. 
\\
Methods: Ten AD patients participated in music therapy using singing training once a week for 6 months (music therapy group). Each session was performed with professional musicians using karaoke and a unique voice training method (the YUBA Method). Before and after the intervention period, each patient was assessed by neuropsychological batteries, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed while the patients sang familiar songs with a karaoke device. As the control group, another 10 AD patients were recruited and neuropsychological assessments were performed twice with an interval of 6 months. 
\\
Results: In the music therapy group, the time for completion of the Japanese Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices was significantly reduced (p = 0.026), and the results obtained from interviewing the patients' caregivers revealed a significant decrease in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score (p = 0.042) and a prolongation of the patients' sleep time (p = 0.039). The fMRI study revealed increased activity in the right angular gyrus and the left lingual gyrus in the before-minus-after subtraction analysis of the music therapy intervention. 
\\
Conclusion: Music therapy intervention using singing training may be useful for dementia patients by improving the neural efficacy of cognitive processing.},

From a Meta-analysis: Clusters of changes in activity in various regions in response to music: nuclei in the amygdala, the hippocampal formation, right ventral striatum (including nucleus accumbens) extending into the ventral pallidum, the head of the left caudate nucleus, the audi- tory cortex, the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA), the cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Thus, music can evoke activity changes in the core brain regions that underlie emotion.
\\
The amygdala has high network centrality within emotion networks: it has high structural centrality, and is connected with several other computational hubs.
The nucleus accumbens shows activity during intense feelings of music-evoked pleasure and reward (musical frissons). 
Dopamine availability has been shown to increase in the dorsal striatum during the anticipation of a musical frisson and in the ventral striatum during the experience of the frisson.
Hippocampus is involved with music-evoked tenderness, peacefulness, joy, frissons, or sadness.

Five patients with severe ABI and matched controls completed the experimental music (MEAM) task (a written questionnaire) while listening to 50 "Number 1 Songs of the Year" (from 1960 to 2010). Patients also completed the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI) and a standard neuropsychological assessment.

The relative preservation of MEAMs in four cases was particularly noteworthy given their impaired verbal and/or visual anterograde memory, and in three cases, autobiographical memory impairment. The majority of MEAMs in both cases and matched controls were of a person/people or a period of life. In three patients music was more efficient at evoking autobiographical memories than the AMI verbal prompts. This is the first study of MEAMs after ABI.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of music therapy on BPSD, cognitive function, and activities of daily living in patients with dementia. A literature search was conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi. We selected 20 studies, including randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, and controlled trials, and conducted a meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD). The results showed that music therapy had moderate effects on anxiety [SMD, −0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), −1.05 -- −0.24; p = 0.002] and small effects on behavioral symptoms (SMD, −0.49; 95% CI, −0.82 -- −0.17; p = 0.003). In studies of duration >3 months, music therapy had large effects on anxiety (SMD, −0.93; 95% CI, −1.72 -- −0.13; p = 0.02). The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that music therapy is effective for the management of BPSD.},

Therefore, the quality of mental processes relies partly on the interaction between the brain's physiological maturation and individual daily experiences. In this review, we focus on the neural implementation of musical expertise at both an anatomical and a functional level. We then discuss how this neural implementation can explain transfers from musical learning to a broad range of non-musical cognitive functions, including language, especially during child development. Finally, given that brain plasticity is still present in aging, we gather arguments to propose that musical practice could be a good environmental enrichment to promote cerebral and cognitive reserves, thereby reducing the deleterious effect of aging on cognitive functions.},

	Abstract = {In Alzheimer patients with a solid musical background, isolated case-reports have reported the maintenance of remarkable musical abilities despite clear difficulties in their verbal memory and linguistic functions. These reports have encouraged a number of scientists to undertake more systematic studies which would allow a rigorous approach to the analysis of musical memory in Alzheimer patients with no formal musical background. Although restricted in number, the latest data are controversial regarding preserved musical capacities in Alzheimer patients. Our current review of the literature addresses this topic and advances the hypothesis that the processes of musical memory are function of illness progression. In the earlier stages, the majority of evaluations concerned musical episodic memory and suggested a dysfunction of this memory whereas in the moderate and severe stages, musical semantic memory and implicit learning are the majority of investigations and seemed more resistant to Alzheimer disease. In summary, our current review bring to understand the memory circuits involved and highlight the necessity to adapted the investigational tools employed to conform with the severity of the signs and symptoms of progressive Alzheimer disease in order to demonstrate the preserved musical capacities.},

For this purpose, young adults, older adults, and patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) were asked to remember autobiographical events in two conditions: after being exposed to their own chosen music, and in silence. Compared to memories evoked in silence, memories evoked in the " Music" condition were found to be more specific, accompanied by more emotional content and impact on mood, and retrieved faster. In addition, these memories engaged less executive processes. Thus, with all these characteristics and the fact that they are activated by a perceptual cue (i.e., music), music-evoked autobiographic memories have all the features to be considered as involuntary memories. Our paper reveals several characteristics of music-evoked autobiographical memories in AD patients and offers a theoretical background for this phenomenon. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Our paper aims to investigate the involuntary nature of the music-enhanced autobiographical recall in AD patients. Therefore, AD patients and older adults were asked to generate autobiographical memories in two conditions: in silence and after music exposure. In general, we predicted that memories evocated after music exposure would have a more involuntary nature than memories evocated in silence. More specifically, and in line with previous research investigating the nature of involuntary memories, we hypothesized that music-evoked autobiographical memories would: (1) be more specific, (2) be accompanied with more emotional content and impact on mood, (3) be retrieved faster, and (4) engage fewer executive processes than memories evoked in silence.

	Abstract = {Findings on song perception and song production have increasingly suggested that common but partially distinct neural networks exist for processing lyrics and melody. However, the neural substrates of song recognition remain to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the neural substrates involved in the accessing "song lexicon" as corresponding to a representational system that might provide links between the musical and phonological lexicons using positron emission tomography (PET). We exposed participants to auditory stimuli consisting of familiar and unfamiliar songs presented in three ways: sung lyrics (song), sung lyrics on a single pitch (lyrics), and the sung syllable 'la' on original pitches (melody). The auditory stimuli were designed to have equivalent familiarity to participants, and they were recorded at exactly the same tempo. Eleven right-handed nonmusicians participated in four conditions: three familiarity decision tasks using song, lyrics, and melody and a sound type decision task (control) that was designed to engage perceptual and prelexical processing but not lexical processing. The contrasts (familiarity decision tasks versus control) showed no common areas of activation between lyrics and melody. This result indicates that essentially separate neural networks exist in semantic memory for the verbal and melodic processing of familiar songs. Verbal lexical processing recruited the left fusiform gyrus and the left inferior occipital gyrus, whereas melodic lexical processing engaged the right middle temporal sulcus and the bilateral temporo-occipital cortices. Moreover, we found that song specifically activated the left posterior inferior temporal cortex, which may serve as an interface between verbal and musical representations in order to facilitate song recognition.},

Investigation of the neural substrates of song recognition via direct comparison between three types of sound stimuli: lyrics, melody, and song. 
Based on previous research they expected to see distinct neural pathways involved in lyrics and melody processing in the stage of lexical lookup of songs. 
The lexical lookup of songs takes place after the perceptual and phonological processing. 
\\
METHODS: 24 familiar and 24 unfamiliar songs.
3 conditions - original lyrics+original melody, original lyrics and rhythm+single tone, sung 'la' to original melody. 
During PET scanning, participants listened to stimuli and determined if the stimulus came from a familiar or unfamiliar song.
\\
RESULTS: reaction time for responding was significantly faster in the full song condition than in lyrics or melody only. 
Some activated regions in the Song contrast were common to those found in the lyrics and melody contrast. This may represent verbal lexical processing and melodic lexical processing in song recognition, respectively. 
Demonstrates essentially separate neural networks controlling verbal processing and melodic processing during lexical lookup of songs.
The left PITC appears to play a crucial role in lexical lookup of songs as an interface area between lyrics and melody to facilitate the recognition of familiar songs. },

Whereas several studies demonstrate an overlap of core structures (Broca's area, premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule), preliminary findings are discussed that imply, if confirmed, the existence of a tonal and a phonological loop in musicians. This conclusion is based on the findings of partly differing neural networks underlying verbal and tonal WM in musicians, suggesting that functional plasticity has been induced by musical training. We further propose a strong link between production and auditory WM: data indicate that both verbal and tonal auditory WM are based on the knowledge of how to produce the to-be-remembered sounds and, therefore, that sensorimotor representations are involved in the temporary maintenance of auditory information in WM.},

Patients with AD and healthy older adults studied visually presented novel song lyrics related to instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) that were accompanied by either a sung or a spoken recording.
Overall, participants performed better on a memory test of general lyric content for lyrics that were studied sung as compared to spoken. However, on a memory test of specific lyric content, participants performed equally well for sung and spoken lyrics. 
We interpret these results in terms of a dual-process model of recognition memory such that the general content questions represent a familiarity-based representation that is preferentially sensitive to enhancement via music, while the specific content questions represent a recollection-based representation unaided by musical encoding. Additionally, in a test of basic recognition memory for the audio stimuli, patients with AD demonstrated equal discrimination for sung and spoken stimuli.},

The musical lexicon contains a perceptual representation system for isolated tunes, much in the same way as the mental word lexicon represents isolated words. It also contains the rules of musical syntax. The music-recognition model proposed by Peretz and Coltheart (2003) provides a functional architecture for the study of musical semantic memory. In the case of brain damage the flow of information to the musical lexicon may be selectively impaired or spared. The model also queries the relationship between memory for music and for lyrics - proposes close associative links. Thus, if memory for spoken lyrics is impaired, there still may be sufficient activation in the phonologiacal lexicon to co-acivate the musical lexicon. Lyric recognition through association.

Both explicit and implicit measures were obtained. Explicit memory was assessed by the accuracy of discrimination of the target melodies from the foils. Younger adults were significantly more accurate than older adults, who in turn had significantly higher scores than AD adults. Implicit memory was assessed by examin- ing the difference in pleasantness ratings between target and foil melodies. Younger adults showed significantly greater differences in pleasantness ratings than older adults and AD adults; scores for the two latter groups did not differ. To assess semantic memory, participants were asked to identify traditional melodies within a series of traditional and novel melodies. In contrast to the episodic memory results, all three groups showed very high scores on the semantic memory task with no significant differences among groups.

	Abstract = {Recognizing a musical excerpt without necessarily retrieving its title typically reflects the existence of a memory system dedicated to the retrieval of musical knowledge. The functional distinction between musical and verbal semantic memory has seldom been investigated. In this fMRI study, we directly compared the musical and verbal memory of 20 nonmusicians, using a congruence task involving automatic semantic retrieval and a familiarity task requiring more thorough semantic retrieval. In the former, participants had to access their semantic store to retrieve musical or verbal representations of melodies or expressions they heard, in order to decide whether these were then given the right ending or not. In the latter, they had to judge the level of familiarity of musical excerpts and expressions. Both tasks revealed activation of the left inferior frontal and posterior middle temporal cortices, suggesting that executive and selection processes are common to both verbal and musical retrievals. Distinct patterns of activation were observed within the left temporal cortex, with musical material mainly activating the superior temporal gyrus and verbal material the middle and inferior gyri. This cortical organization of musical and verbal semantic representations could explain clinical dissociations featuring selective disturbances for musical or verbal material. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

\\
To determine the brain regions mainly involved in semantic retrieval. Used a congruence and a familiarity task. Congruence task: verbal and musical content - does the second half match the first half of the melody/proverb. These were contrasted with a perceptual reference condition (are the note sequences/syllable sequences the same)
\\
Familiarity task: rate the level of familiarity of 60 melodies and 60 expressions. Songs with lyrics were not included as well as songs that might elicit strong autobiographical memories. Tasks were completed in a 3T scanner.
\\
Musical semantic contrast bilaterally activated the STG, superior and middle TG, inferior frontal gyrus, SMA. Verbal semantic contrast revealed only left-sided activation in angular gyrus, middle and inferior temporal gyri.
Familiarity - bilateral activation to music, left activation to verbal. 
\\
Results confirm a distinction between networks responsible for musical and verbal semantic memory. 
music recognition process can be broken down into two stages: access and selection. We suggest that the left superior temporal gyrus subserves the access stage and the inferior frontal area the selection one.
Overall, our present data suggest that the temporal cortex is organized along an inferior/superior axis depending of the nature of the material being retrieved. The musical material mainly activated the superior temporal cortex, whereas the middle and inferior temporal cortex was activated by the verbal material. 
. This inferior/superior organization within the left temporal cortex could help in understanding the clinical dissociations that are observed (Piccirilli et al., 2000) and the disproportionate preservation of musical knowledge in semantic dementia contrasting with severely impaired verbal skills (Hailstone et al., 2009).},

	Abstract = {The notion that memory for music can be preserved in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has been raised by a number of case studies. In this paper, we review the current research examining musical memory in patients with AD. In keeping with models of memory described in the non-musical domain, we propose that various forms of musical memory exist, and may be differentially impaired in AD, reflecting the pattern of neuropathological changes associated with the condition. Our synthesis of this literature reveals a dissociation between explicit and implicit musical memory functions. Implicit, specifically procedural musical memory, or the ability to play a musical instrument, can be spared in musicians with AD. In contrast, explicit musical memory, or the recognition of familiar or unfamiliar melodies, is typically impaired. Thus, the notion that music is unforgettable in AD is not wholly supported. Rather, it appears that the ability to play a musical instrument may be unforgettable in some musicians with AD.},
	Annote = {REVIEW (with table describing studies)
\\
A distinction can be made between implicit and explicit musical memory, but the practical assessment of musical memory does not currently reflect these distinct memory forms. 
\\
Lesion case studies suggest existence of a memory system specialized for music that involves the temporal lobe regions. Learning and recogntion involves both left and right. Recognition mainly involves right. Imaging studies have shown involvement of the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, and frontal lobes.
Predominantly left sided activation is associated with familiar music.
\\
Non-musicians have increased activity in motor cortices (compared to pianists) when performing complex finger tasks. This may reflect the efficiency of a pianists's motor cortex. However, pianists have more secondary motor cortex activity when listening to music. These areas are typically not affected by AD pathology. 
It is likely that the nature of musical memory representations and their neural correlates differ between these two groups.
\\
There are 3 ways to assess explicit memory for familiar music: 1. familiarity judgements, 2. recall or completion task, 3. listening followed by yes/no recognition task. Recognition (explicit) is impaired in AD patients. Neural correlates of \textbf{implicit} musical memory are relatively unknown. Two forms of implicit memory have been assessed in AD patients: mere exposure effect (MEE tests liking judgements), and procedural musical memory (PMM - preserved ability to play instruments). MEE - inconsistent results, may only pe preserved in early stages of AD.  PMM - even in severe AD the ability to play an instrument can be preserved.
\\
\hl{Hypothesis that dementia is less common among musicians than the regular population}
\\
Music seems to have a facilitatory effect, but methodological rigour is lacking in studies that investigate this issue (music therapy studies). Enhanced autobiographical recall associated with music listening may be due to the emotional and/or arousal effects of the music. Considering differences between musicians and non-musicians will be important in researching this isue. It is also important to consider other dementias. },

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We can easily recognize familiar music by listening to only one or 2 of its opening bars, but the brain regions that participate in this cognitive processing remain undetermined. We used positron-emission tomography (PET) to study changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) that occur during listening to familiar music. METHODS: We used a PET subtraction technique to elucidate the brain regions associated with the recognition of familiar melodies such as well-known nursery tunes. Nonmusicians performed 2 kinds of musical tasks: judging the familiarity of musical pieces (familiarity task) and detecting deliberately altered notes in the pieces (alteration-detecting task). RESULTS: During the familiarity task, bilateral anterior portions of bilateral temporal lobes, superior temporal regions, and parahippocampal gyri were activated. The alteration-detecting task bilaterally activated regions in the precunei, superior/inferior parietal lobules, and lateral surface of frontal lobes, which seemed to show a correlation with the analysis of music. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that during the familiarity task, activated brain regions participate in retrieval from long-term memory and verbal and emotional processing of familiar melodies. Our results reinforced the hypothesis reported in the literature as a result of group and case studies, that temporal lobe regions participate in the recognition of familiar melodies.},

	Abstract = {Despite intriguing and suggestive clinical observations, no formal research has assessed the possible sparing of musical recognition and memory in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). A case study is presented of an 84-year old woman with severe cognitive impairment implicating AD, but for whom music recognition and memory, according to her caregivers, appeared to be spared. The hypotheses addressed were, first, that memory for familiar music may be spared in dementia, and second, that musical recognition and memory may be reliably assessed with existing tests if behavioral observation is employed to overcome the problem of verbal or written communication. Our hypotheses were stimulated by the patient EN, for whom diagnosis of AD became probable in 2000. With severe problems in memory, language, and cognition, she now has a mini-mental status score of 8 (out of 30) and is unable to understand or recall standard instructions. In order to assess her music recognition abilities, three tests from the previous literature were adapted for behavioral observation. Two tests involved the discrimination of familiar melodies from unfamiliar melodies. The third involved the detection of distortions ("wrong" notes) in familiar melodies and discrimination of distorted melodies from melodies correctly reproduced. Test melodies were presented to EN on a CD player and her responses were observed by two test administrators. EN responded to familiar melodies by singing along, usually with the words, and often continuing to sing after the stimulus had stopped. She never responded to the unfamiliar melodies. She responded to distorted melodies with facial expressions - surprise, laughter, a frown, or an exclamation, "Oh, dear!"; she never responded in this way to the undistorted melodies. Allowing these responses as indicators of detection, the results for EN were in the normal or near normal range of scores for elderly controls. As well, lyrics to familiar melodies, spoken in a conversational voice without rhythmic or pitch clues, often prompted EN to sing the tune that correctly accompanied the lyrics. EN's results provide encouraging support for our hypotheses that sparing of musical memory may be a feature of some forms of dementia and that it may be reliably and quantitatively assessed through behavioral observation. The contrast between EN's response to music and her mini-mental status is dramatic. The article concludes with several considerations why music may be preserved in dementia and suggestions to guide future research. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

\\
In AD, the earliest spectral changes at rest are an increase in theta activity, accompanied by a decrease in beta activity, which are followed by a decrease in alpha activity. Delta frequency increases later during the course of the disease.
Studies have shown that EEG interhemispheric coherence at rest decreases with age, and patients with AD have further reductions in alpha and delta band coherence (at rest).
Objective: To examine memory-related EEG power and coherence over temporal and central recording sites in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal controls. 
\\
Participants: 10 patients with mild AD with a matched control group
Method: EEG was recorded from central (Fz, Cz and Pz) and temporal (T3 and T4) electrodes while ten very mild AD patients and ten controls performed a Sternberg-type memory scanning task with three levels of working memory load. Spectral power in delta (0--3 Hz), theta (3--5 Hz), lower alpha1 (5--7 Hz), lower alpha2 (7--9 Hz), upper alpha (9--11 Hz) and beta (15--30 Hz) was averaged for temporal and central electrodes. Coherence was averaged between central electrodes, between central and right temporal electrodes and between central and left temporal electrodes. 
\\
Results: While behavioral performance of very mild AD patients did not differ significantly from that of normal controls, findings suggest that normal controls but not AD patients respond to memory demands by increasing upper alpha power over temporal cortex. When compared with normal controls, AD patients had reduced upper alpha coherence between central and right temporal cortex.
\\
Discussion: Results are consistent with previous research on the role of upper alpha in semantic memory and suggest that very mild AD may inhibit selective synchronization of upper alpha in temporal lobes.},
